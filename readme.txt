iso

iso is a simple JavaScript framework for drawing isometric blocks on an HTML 5 canvas.  Isometric drawings let you portray things in a way that looks a bit like 3D.  I designed it for use as the graphics engine in a game but it might also be useful for various types of artwork.

The order that you draw the blocks is important.
